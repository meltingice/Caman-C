# Caman-C

This is a port of the Javascript image manipulation library [CamanJS](https://github.com/meltingice/CamanJS) to C. I have been unable to find any decent C libraries for manipulating images in a simple and easy to understand way. This is the result.

Image manipulation is done using Imagemagick via the MagickWand API. The project is currently very rough, and likely doesn't work.

PS: I suck at Makefiles.
